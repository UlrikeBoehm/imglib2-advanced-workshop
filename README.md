# imglib2-advanced-workshop

Source code and slides for the Workshop "Advanced Programming with ImgLib2" first held at the ImageJ User and Developer Conference 2012.
The workshop is focused on writing generic *n*-dimensional algorithms of increasing complexity.
It starts from a simple `copy()` method and leads up to Lucas-Kanade-style gradient-based image alignment.

Each task comprises an incomplete example and a solution. For example, `t1copy.CopyExample1` is the first task, with TODO comments indicating which parts need to be filled in.
The completed solutions can be found in `completed` sub-packages respectively, in this case `t1copy.completed.CopyExample1`.
